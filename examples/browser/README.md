## Example: epubber in browser

In general, every bundler like `esbuild` or `webpack` should work just fine. 

### Build

`npm run build` (in repository root)  
`node build.js` (in this folder).

### Serve

`npx serve dist -l tcp://127.0.0.1:5010` (in this folder)

### See

Open http://127.0.0.1:5010/ in your browser
